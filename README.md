I am a former solicitor and recent graduate of Makers Academy, a coding bootcamp.  I am looking to join a supportive team environment which will enable me to contribute and to continue to develop my skills.

During my time as a solicitor I specialised in pensions law and advised a variety of clients, ranging from the trustees of multi-billion pound pension schemes to small charities. I greatly enjoyed my time as a lawyer but felt that the time was right for a new challenge.  Having initially started learning to code as a weekend hobby and to try to understand more deeply something which is increasingly important in society and business, I realised that it was not only something which I enjoy and which suits my skills but also a potential new career.

## Skills

#### Problem solving

Problem solving is a key aspect of the Makers Academy bootcamp and legal practice.  Through my experience I have developed this skill and follow a logical process when faced with a new problem.  The TDD approach taught at Makers has helped me to further refine this process and ensure that my approach is applicable to coding.

#### Clarity and attention to detail

A missing set of parentheses can prevent an app from running.  In a legal context inconsistency in the usage of a definition or ambiguous drafting can lead to lengthly and costly disputes.  To avoid these pitfalls in the short term it is necessary to pay close attention to detail and to develop the habit of checking work as you proceed: in coding following the red-green-refactor TDD cycle and appling the SOLID design principles are useful methods for achieving this.  In the longer term, making work (whether code or documentation) that is easy to read and change is vital to ensuring that the product has an acceptable lifespan.

#### Project management

In my time as a solicitor I was invovled in many long-term projects, both as a project leader and as a specialist within a larger team.  I allocated and supervised the work of other team members, ensuring that it was completed on schedule and matched the requirements of the project and the expectations of the client, whilst also carrying out my own tasks.  This supervisory role helped me to understand better how to respond both to clients and to managers.

#### Collaborative working

The Makers Academy course focusses on pair programming and involves several group projects.  In my career I often worked with other specialists.  In order to provide the most appropriate and efficient service to clients it was necessary to understand the roles of each team member, to liaise regularly in order to spot any potential issues as early as possible, and to trust the other specialists to deliver.

## Experience

**Travers Smith LLP** (March 2008 to August 2018)    
*Senior Associate*  

I was a member of the award-winning Pensions team at this law firm.

## Interests

I love to travel, particularly if it involves skiing, scuba, hiking or kayaking.  I have always enjoyed the theatre, although since peaking at University with a three week run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this has largely been limited to watching plays rather than performing. 

Since January 2017 I have acted as a trustee for a charity, [HAEUK](https://www.haeuk.org/), which assists individuals who have hereditary angioedema as well as their families.  I have found this incredibly rewarding as it has enabled me to apply my legal knowledge in a more personal context, although I am not solely on the board in a legal capacity.
